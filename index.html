                <p>Hi there, if you came from LinkedIn (according to the "src" search parameter you likely did) this is in fact my personal website, the name "Takina" is used because I've long been an anonymous developer in the internet publishing programs I created,
                    I've had some websites in the past, the previous one was <a href="https://lycorishq.link">lycorishq.link</a> but I archived it together with all software present on it.
                </p>
                <p>Either way, Yes, this website is owned by Henrique Natalucci.</p>

                <p>I did do a lot of promises, and I would like to apologize to anyone who wanted to try out Irie Composer;
                   it is a really complicated project that requires a lot of work, (and a lot of my sanity too); in relation to AngelARC, it's
                currently on its very early stages only really supporting 16 bit operations and in a very infant stage, in a few months however ill
                show off a demo of it running from an FPGA.</p>
                <p>As far as updates go, thats all I have to say, but! I do have news for all of those that actually read this:
                First off, thank you, a lot! just by opening this website and reading the things I write here, thank you!
                And second.. I have a surprise incoming to everyone who reads this, just hold on for a little longer, and a great gift will come.
                Thanks everyone for your support! and I hope you all have a nice day, night or afternoon!

                <h2>Irie Composer rewrite & about ARM and macOS support <span>May 20, 2024</span></h2>
                <p>
                    <p>Turns out my code for irie composer's UI and functionalities was very, very attatched to windows, 
                    in a way that even trying to cross-compile it is incredibly painful.</p>
                    <p>Therefore I've began a boring process of recoding it entirely and building it under a linux distro in a VM and
                    constantly cross-compiling to windows and building for the linux distro I'm in.</p>
                    <h3>About ARM and macOS</h3>
                    <p>I don't have any apple devices so I can't realiably test and develop Irie Composer for macOS.
                    Maybe one day I'll get my hands on a cheap macbook and code it to support macOS? if that ever happens, you can be sure
                    I'll code support for it to work under ARM hosts aswell. the thing is, only way to have OpenGL 3.3 on ARM is to emulate it
                    which doesn't offers the most optimal performance</p>
                    <p>Sure, Irie Composer isn't a grafically intense application, but it wouldn't make sense to provide ARM builds when the
                    program itself uses emulation to run on the platform, I wouldn't want that in my text editor.</p>
                    <p>That's it for news. it's a lot harder to support multiple operating systems and architectures than I had originally imagined.</p>
                </p>

            <div class="article">
                <h2>A feather-like text editor <span>March 7, 2024</span></h2>
                <p>
                    <p>Text editors nowadays (the fancy ones like vscode, sublime,
                        and whatever is the new cool editor in the block) all have the same issue:
                    they can't seem to use little resources, they're all amazingly heavy. 
                    So, I decided to ditch out electron and all the weird frameworks for a code editor 
                    written from scratch inspired by no other than Netscape Composer (at least.. the name Composer)</p>
                    <p>I shall present.. the new.. Irie Composer!</p>
                    <img src="/icons/news/iriecomposer-dbg.png">
                    <p>yeah.. not finished so its not that worth to already start comparing it to the modern ones.. but hey, its going there.
                        UI was written from scratch with OpenGL, and text rendering being done using Multi Signed Distance Fields (<a href="https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen">MSDF</a>)
                        But not to worry, it sounds heavy but its really efficient, quite more than mesh based font rendering.
                        Fonts used are the same as the websites, with the exception the editor uses MPLUS Code instead of IBM Plex Mono.
                    </p>
                    <p>Anyway, that's enough for today. I'll keep posting updates on this project here and eventually give its own <a href="/projects/irie-composer/">page</a> once it becomes usable.</p>

                <p>This isn't exactly very nice of me, but.. if you wish, you can help me stay alive by donating even a single cent of USD in ether to the address <span class="red">0xd846B8b57662C79b9Fae6d3A9df7E86Aa01Fb35D</span>!
                right now most of my income goes to my university which leaves me with very little funds to actually invest in my programming endevaours (and food).
                It's entirely up to you though! you dont have to donate at all, simply by reading this website you already give me great motivation to keep moving forward! ðŸ’™</p>
