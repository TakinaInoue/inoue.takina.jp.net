                <h2>A feather-like text editor <span>March 7, 2024</span></h2>
                <p>
                    <p>Text editors nowadays (the fancy ones like vscode, sublime,
                        and whatever is the new cool editor in the block) all have the same issue:
                    they can't seem to use little resources, they're all amazingly heavy. 
                    So, I decided to ditch out electron and all the weird frameworks for a code editor 
                    written from scratch inspired by no other than Netscape Composer (at least.. the name Composer)</p>
                    <p>I shall present.. the new.. Irie Composer!</p>
                    <img src="/icons/news/iriecomposer-dbg.png">
                    <p>yeah.. not finished so its not that worth to already start comparing it to the modern ones.. but hey, its going there.
                        UI was written from scratch with OpenGL, and text rendering being done using Multi Signed Distance Fields (<a href="https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen">MSDF</a>)
                        But not to worry, it sounds heavy but its really efficient, quite more than mesh based font rendering.
                        Fonts used are the same as the websites, with the exception the editor uses MPLUS Code instead of IBM Plex Mono.
                    </p>
                    <p>Anyway, that's enough for today. I'll keep posting updates on this project here and eventually give its own <a href="/projects/irie-composer/">page</a> once it becomes usable.</p>
